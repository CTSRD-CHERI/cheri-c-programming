# Background

CHERI extends conventional processor Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with
support for *architectural capabilities*.
One important use for this new hardware data type is in the implementation
of safer C/C++ pointers and the code or data they point at.
Our technical report, [*An Introduction to
CHERI*](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-941.pdf), provides a
more detailed overview of the CHERI architecture, ISA modeling, hardware
implementations, and software stack[^1].
