## Version history

The first version of this report was published in June 2020.
The current web version is a living document being prepared for release as a
second edition in late 2025, based on five years of deployed experience with
hundreds of CHERI C/C++ developers working on various CHERI platforms
including Arm's Morello prototype, Microsoft's CHERIoT, Codasip's X730,
the University of Cambridge's CHERI-Toooba, and Capabilities Limited's
CVA6-CHERI platforms.

The following broad categories of changes have been made since the 2020
release:

 * Conversion to mdbook from LaTeX to enable a live web version.
 * Update cited articles and technical reports.
 * Better define, and discourage use of, CHERI Hybrid C/C++.
 * Include information on using CHERI C/C++ on a more diverse range of
   platforms, including Morello and CHERIoT, as well as work on arising
   CHERI-adapted OSes such as CHERI Linux and seL4.
 * Include information on printing capability values via `strfcap(3)` and
   `printf(3)`.
 * Numerous minor editorial and formatting improvements.
