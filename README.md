This is the CHERI Pure-Capability C/C++ Programming Guide, a short guide to
help developers working with pure-capability C/C++ understand the benefits
that it brings, any code adaptations they might need to make, and how to
interpret new compiler warnings and errors that arise with pure-capability
code.
