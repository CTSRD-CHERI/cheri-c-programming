This is the CHERI Pure-Capability C/C++ Programming Guide, a short guide to
help developers working with pure-capability C/C++ understand the benefits
that it brings, any code adaptations they might need to make, and how to
interpret new compiler warnings and errors that arise with pure-capability
code.

*This is a living document; feedback and contributions are welcomed.
Please see our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheri-c-programming) for

There is a [rendered version on the web](https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheri-c-programming/), which is automatically updated when the git repository is
committed to.*

## Building

Building the book from the Markdown sources requires
[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Once installed, `mdbook build`
will build the static HTML files in the `book/` directory, whilst `mdbook
serve` will build and serve them at `http://localhost:3000`. Please refer to
the mdBook documentation for futher options.
